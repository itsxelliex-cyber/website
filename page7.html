    <h3> my favorite school subjects (and why): 
        <ul> AP World History: Modern
            <li> i am taking this class right now, and i absolutely love it! i have never been a huge fan of history, since i mainly learned about American history in school, but learning about other countries, cultures, beliefs, interactions, and how they came to be is super interesting to me! everyone hates the textbook homework we get for that class, but i secretly love it! i love immersing myself into these ancient worlds and imagining what life was like back then!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul> Show Choir
        <li>
            i knew i always wanted to do choir since middle school, but i never got the chance since i had to fulfill my other credits. however, last year i was able to sign up for show choir and i absolutely loved it! the dynamic is not like most classes; we all have a friendly relationship with each other and i feel super comfortable in that environment. i have made so many friends in that class! i love my teacher and am currently part of the leadership team in the class.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul> AP Computer Science Java
        <li>
            unlike AP CSP, which was about the principles of computer science, this class focuses more on the coding aspect of computer science. we often get debugging assignments in class, and even though they are challenging sometimes, i like to imagine it almost kind of like a puzzle. tricky, yet satisfying once solved. i can't wait for all the projects i will get to build in this class!

        </li>
        </ul>
