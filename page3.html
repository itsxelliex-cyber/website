    <p>
        hi! my name is elroi eskndir and i'm 16 years old living in the united states. this is my first website! 
        i made this website to share some of my interests and fun facts that i like. i've always been interested in coding, and being in spaces like girls who code and the athena award have really inspired me to pursue coding and make projects!
        i currently know html,css, and a little bit of javascript. i am learning java in my ap computer science class right now, so hopefully in the future i can make a project using that coding language!
        another one of my interests is music, specifically singing. i would love to make an app one day combining these two interests of mine, but for now, check out this website and follow my journey! 
    </p>
    <p>
        love, elroi ‚ù§
