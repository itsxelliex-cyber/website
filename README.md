# website
my personal website, kind of like my "mark" on the web!
WHAT my website is:
my project is a personal website showcasing all the different parts of me. going through this website you will find out about all the things i like, including hobbies, projects, and interests!

WHY i made it:
i used to see those neocities websites and how people were able to perfectly customize their website to their liking. it made me want to share my stuff with the world. i'm not there yet, but i am getting there and i am determined to secure my sweet corner on the internet!

HOW i made it:
this project is made with html, which creates the structure for the website. for all the cool designs and fonts, i used css to design that. and for functionality (the most important part) i used javascript to work those parts out.

something i struggled with: at first i watched an html tutorial to understand how to build a website, and it was all challenging at first, but i'm getting better!
